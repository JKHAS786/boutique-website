If your order is accepted, we will inform you by e-mail and we will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted with. This will usually be <strong>Boutique</strong> or may in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third party, <strong>Boutique</strong> is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order, you undertake that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, and you are an authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and there are sufficient funds to cover the costs of the goods. The costs of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes.</p><p><br><strong>Our Contract</strong></p><p>When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming our receipt of your order: this e-mail will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us will not be formed until we send you confirmation by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.</p><p><br><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong></p><p>Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered, we will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a credit note in your account. Where applicable, prices are inclusive of TAXATION at the rate appropriate to the country of receipt. TAXATION is not included in our prices for customers outside SINGAPORE. Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in the 'Total Cost'.</p><p><br><strong>Rejection of goods purchased</strong></p><p><strong>Boutique</strong> values our customers and we will ensure the best quality of the goods. If you are not satisfied with our goods, please notify us and we will try to provide an exchange. Please kindly note that the exchange policy only applies for major defects of goods during delivery. In cases where <strong>Boutique</strong> is unable to provide an exchange, we will do a refund on the goods purchased.</p><p><br><strong>Payment</strong></p><p>Upon receipt of your order, we will carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card to ensure that there are sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Goods will not be dispatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed. Your card will be debited once your order has been accepted.</p><p><strong><br>Discount Codes</strong></p><p>a. Account discount codes - Discount codes may from time to time be offered to account holders; such codes may only be applied to purchases made through the account in respect of which the discount code was offered and registered.</p><p>b.

We are afraid that we will not be responsible for any delays, no matter how they are caused.</p><p>d. If you are the purchaser, please double check the delivery e-mail address you enter – it is your responsibility to do so and we cannot be held responsible if a gift voucher is used by someone other than your recipient if the e-mail address entered is incorrect.<br>In addition, we can't take responsibility for any gift vouchers that are lost or used by someone other than your recipient after delivery. Make sure your recipient has received the gift voucher as it is their responsibility to keep the voucher details safe.</p><p>e. From time to time, gift vouchers may get caught in pesky spam filters, and it is up to the recipient to check these filters. We cannot take responsibility if a gift voucher cannot be delivered to the recipient's email address because of spam filters, firewalls, the capacity of the recipient's mailbox or any other factors which are outside of our control.</p><p>f. If you need a refund/exchange, this will be made in the same way as the original payment method (such as onto a gift voucher, debit/credit card account, or a combination of the two).</p><p>g.
